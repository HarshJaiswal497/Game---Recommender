# About

I built a Game Recommender Web Application called "GameHub" using React, designed to provide users with a curated list of games based on categories and popularity. The project focuses on delivering a clean, interactive, and user-friendly experience.

Overview of Features
1. Game Listings & Categorization – Displays a list of games sorted by genre and popularity.
2.  Filtering & Sorting – Users can filter games based on categories and sort them by rating or release date.
3.  Dynamic Data Fetching – The app fetches game data dynamically, ensuring up-to-date recommendations.
4.  Responsive UI – A well-structured, mobile-friendly layout with reusable components.
